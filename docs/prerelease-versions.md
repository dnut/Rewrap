## Pre-release versions

Pre-release versions are used to test or hammer-out new features before they're added to
the stable branch. Releases are more frequent and features come earlier to these versions.

You can switch to the Pre-Release channel from within VS Code (v1.63 or above) by going to
the extension's page and then choosing **Switch to Pre-Release Version** (make sure to hit
"Reload Required" after it's installed).

You don't have to be using VS Code Insiders to do this. You can painlessly switch back to
the stable channel at any time too. [More info at the VS Code docs](
https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_63#_pre-release-extensions).


### Visual Studio

Visual Studio doesn't have the above VS Code feature, but you can still download the .vsix
file from the **Assets** section below, and install it manually by double-clicking the
file. When the next major stable version is released, VS will automatically upgrade to
that.
