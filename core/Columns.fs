module internal Columns

// Deals the [wrapping to rulers
// feature](https://dnut.github.io/Rewrap/#/settings-vscode#wrapping-to-rulers).
// The user can have multiple "rulers" (potential wrapping columns) set, either
// with the `editor.rulers` setting in VSCode or the Guidelines extension in VS.
//
// When a user opens a document the wrapping column is set at the first ruler in
// their settings. To change it to the next ruler, they have to do a wrap
// (alt+q) twice in a row without doing anything inbetween.
//
// If the user doesn't have any rulers set, we always treat it as if they have
// a list of one ruler (their set wrapping column).

// We store one DocState record for the state of the editor after every wrap
// operation, and then look at it again before the next. If it hasn't changed,
// it's counted as doing a wrap twice in a row, and we move the wrapping column
// to the next ruler (if it exists).
//
// The DocState stores the current filepath, document version number and
// selection position, to make sure the user hasn't switched file, made an
// edit, or even moved the cursor, respectively.
